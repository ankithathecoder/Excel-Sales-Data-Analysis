Project Title:
Biker Sales Insights Dashboard



Project Description:
This project presents an Excel-based dashboard analyzing biker sales data to uncover key trends, customer demographics, and product preferences. The analysis is based on biker sales data from [source, if available], and it covers [time period/scope of analysis].



Data Analysis and Methodology:
The analysis involved multiple stages of data cleaning and transformation to ensure accurate insights:

Data Cleaning: The raw data was cleaned by handling missing values, correcting outliers, and standardizing formats.

Data Transformation: Additional features like Age Bracket were derived from the original data to provide deeper insights into customer profiles.

Techniques Used:

Pivot Tables: To summarize and aggregate key sales metrics (e.g., total sales by region, bike model popularity).

Slicers & Filters: For interactive exploration of data across different segments like age group, region, and bike model.

Charts and Visualizations: Used to illustrate trends and relationships between key factors.



Dashboard Overview:
The interactive dashboard consists of multiple components designed to provide dynamic insights:

Key Components:

Charts: Display trends like bike sales by region, age bracket, and more.

Slicers: Allow users to filter the data by various categories (e.g., age bracket, region).

Key Metrics: Show summaries of important insights (e.g., total sales, most popular bike models).

Dashboard Screenshot:

A visual preview of the dashboard is available in the file Dashboard_Preview.png for quick reference.



Key Findings and Insights:
Customer Profile: Analyzing the bike purchase data reveals a clear customer profile:

Demographics: The most likely bike purchasers are middle-aged males with a higher income bracket, often holding a graduate or bachelor's degree.

Geographical Trends: Sales are most concentrated in the Pacific region, where there seems to be a strong biking culture.

Usage: Longer commute distances are correlated with higher purchase rates, indicating that bikes are being used as practical transportation.

Actionable Insights: Based on the findings, here are some strategies to boost sales:

Target Marketing Campaigns: Focus on middle-aged, college-educated males in high-income brackets.

Regional Focus: Increase marketing efforts in the Pacific region to take advantage of the established biking culture.



Usage Instructions:
Interactive Dashboard: Use the slicers in the dashboard to filter the data by different variables like region, age bracket, and bike model.

Pivot Tables: You can explore the data summaries and key metrics using the Pivot Table sheet.
